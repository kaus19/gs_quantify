# gs_quantify ML Section
GS Quantify is a flagship coding contest organized by Goldman Sachs, a leading global investment bank. We look forward to challenge the best minds of the country on real-world problems that we solve in the realms of computer science (CS), machine learning (ML), and quantitative aptitude. The topics covered include data structures, algorithms, optimization, data science, and many more. You can implement solutions in a programming environment of your choice that would run on real-world/simulated data sets.
